This project is used to develop and prove out the labs used in the jdg_dev course.

 - init_dev.sh is used to setup the lab environment.  This script will not be available to the students

 - init_lab.sh is is used to setup individual lab assignments.  This script will be used by students.

 - installs is a folder where all the downloaded software will be installed from.  This is not included
in the repository.

The labs will be run from the command line, with basic unix commands and maven commands to keep the
labs simple and easy to maintain.
